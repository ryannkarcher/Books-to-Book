# Books-to-Book
Hello!! 

This is the beginning of a website I want to complete to the max! It's an online community that includes book recommendations, writing and reading challenges, prizes, and community pieces so that those who are involved in the Books to Book page can connect with others who read.

As it is not finished yet, I am still working through a couple of ideas and determining what would be best for my target audience. I'm excited to really get into the grit of the code and learn as much as I can about building functional websites that the users can interact with. Now that I'm further into learning code, I am looking forward to building forms that will allow users to get subscriptions, display their challenges, and submit feedback.

Thanks for reading!
